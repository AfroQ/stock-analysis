**Numeric Formating - Explain**

In VBA number formats, the number sign (`#`) is used if you want to display only a significant digit (i.e., any digit that isn't a trailing zero). If you want to display a trailing zero, use the numerical symbol zero (`0`) instead. Adding a percent sign will move the decimal point two digits to the right.
